Foursquare is my favorite! 
I have been curious about my data for a long time. so I would like to explore stories behind my foursquare data.

visualization is a good way to understand data and find stories. so here is how i work in progress.


Q. how can i pull my check-ins from foursquare?<br/>
A. i am going to use <a href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> for prototype. so i need to find some good library for oauth stuffs. <a href="https://twitter.com/lankybutmacho/status/396772891993583616" target="_blank">Matt Healy</a>, a designer at foursqure, recommends <a href="http://nytlabs.com/oauthp5/" target="_blank">oauthP5 library</a>. This is what i want!

Q. how can i map my geolocation data to the screen?<br/>
A. <a href="http://matthewhealy.net/" target="_blank">Matt</a> again! he wrote <a href="http://engineering.foursquare.com/2011/09/26/behind-the-scenes-of-our-week-of-check-ins-visualization/" target="_blank">how he visualized check-ins</a> on foursquare blog. like he says, i play with <a href="https://github.com/RandomEtc/modestmaps-processing" target="_blank">modestmaps library</a>, which is really super easy to convert geolocation to screen and vice versa.

Q. what map am i using?<br/>
A. still looking for good ones...
